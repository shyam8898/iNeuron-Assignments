    "- The practical benefit of this aim is that any user in any location can view Chinese scripts, English alphanumeric characters, or Russian and Arabic text â€“ all within the same file and without having to manually futz with the encoding (code page) for each specific text.\n",
    "- Prior to Unicode, you would probably have needed to select a different code page to see each script, if the script even had a code page and a font that supported it, and you wouldn't be able to view multiple languages / scripts within the same file at all."

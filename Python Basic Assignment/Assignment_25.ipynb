    "- If a function contains at least one yield statement (it may contain other yield or return statements), it becomes a generator function. Both yield and return will return some value from a function.\n",

    "- List comprehension is more concise and easier to read as compared to map.\n",
    "- List comprehension allows filtering. In map, we have no such facility. For example, to print all even numbers in range of 100, we can write [n for n in range(100) if n%2 == 0]. There is no alternate for it in map\n",
    "- List comprehension are used when a list of results is required as map only returns a map object and does not return any list.\n",
    "- List comprehension is faster than map when we need to evaluate expressions that are too long or complicated to express\n",
